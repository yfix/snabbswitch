#
# In `plot' mode: Runs benchmarks for each merge commit in that range and
# records their results unless a record for that run already exists and
# plots the resulting records.
#
# In `check' mode: Compares benchmark results of commits <sha-x> and
# <sha-y> and prints the results.
#
# CPERFDIR must be an absolute path that designates a directory with a
# `benchmarks/' subdirectory containing the benchmark scripts to be run.
