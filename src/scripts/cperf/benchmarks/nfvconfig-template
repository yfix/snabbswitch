# (by using `set -e' and `echo $out | ...'):

# If a benchmark script fails it MUST exit with a non-zero status. Thus
# we make sure that the status returned reflects the benchmarks results
# and NOT the commands that extract the desired portion of the benchmarks
# output. (Last time I checked, even with `set -e ', a plain pipe will
# exit with status 0 even if one of the commands does not).
