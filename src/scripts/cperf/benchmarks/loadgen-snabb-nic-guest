# There is a reason for this Shell script being so weird
# (by using `set -e' and `echo $out | ...'):
#
# If a benchmark script fails it MUST exit with a non-zero status. Thus
# we make sure that the status returned reflects the benchmarks results
# and NOT the commands that extract the desired portion of the benchmarks
# output. (Last time I checked, even with `set -e ', a plain pipe will
# exit with status 0 even if one of the commands does not).

# Commented out for now because loadgen-snabb-nic-guest.sh exists with
# status 1.
#set -e 

# Path to bench_env scripts.
BENCH_ENV=${BENCH_ENV:-"./src/scripts/bench_env"}

# The actual benchmark.
out=$(sudo $BENCH_ENV/loadgen-snabb-nic-guest.sh)

# Extract floating point Mpps number from output.
echo "$out" | tail -n 3 | head -n 1 | cut -f 2
